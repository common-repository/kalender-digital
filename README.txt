Plugin for the integration of a free calendar from Calendar.online or Kalender.digital

== Information ==

With this plugin you can easily integrate a calendar on your website for free.
The calendar is responsive and optimized for all devices by scaling with the size of your device. You can show your events in the day, week, month or year view.
Daily start time, daily end time as well as the time interval are adjustable. For a better overview sub-calendars can be created in different colors.
You can also manage your events conveniently outside your Wordpress installation via a special access link, e.g. on your smartphone.

== How to use ==

1. Please create a free account on [Calendar.online](https://calendar.online) (german speaking users: [Kalender.digital](https://kalender.digital)).
2. Add the shortcode below to your website.
3. Exchange in the shortcode the link to the calendar with your "reader link", which you received by email after registration. You can also find the "reader link" in the settings.
4. You can now easily edit events and settings via your "administrator link", which you received after registration.
